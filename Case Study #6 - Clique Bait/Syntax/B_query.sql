Using a single SQL query - create a new output table which has the following details:
- How many times was each product viewed?
- How many times was each product added to cart?
- How many times was each product added to a cart but not purchased (abandoned)?
- How many times was each product purchased?

--Use your 2 new output tables - answer the following questions:
--1. Which product had the most views, cart adds and purchases?

SELECT TOP 1 *
FROM #product_summary
ORDER BY views DESC;
--> Oyster has the most views.

SELECT TOP 1 *
FROM #product_summary
ORDER BY cart_adds DESC;
--> Lobster had the most cart adds.

SELECT TOP 1 *
FROM #product_summary
ORDER BY purchases DESC;
--> Lobster had the most purchases.


--2. Which product was most likely to be abandoned?
SELECT TOP 1 *
FROM #product_summary
ORDER BY abandoned DESC;
--> Russian Caviar was most likely to be abandoned.


--3. Which product had the highest view to purchase percentage?
SELECT 
  TOP 1 product_name,
  product_category,
  CAST(100.0 * purchases / views AS decimal(10, 2)) AS purchase_per_view_pct
FROM #product_summary
ORDER BY purchase_per_view_pct DESC;
--> Lobster had the highest view to purchase percentage?


--4. What is the average conversion rate from view to cart add?
SELECT 
  CAST(AVG(1.0*cart_adds/views) AS decimal(10, 2)) AS avg_view_to_cart
FROM #product_summary;


--5. What is the average conversion rate from cart add to purchase?
