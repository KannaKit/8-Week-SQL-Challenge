--C. Segment Analysis--
-----------------------

--1. Using our filtered dataset by removing the interests with less than 6 months worth of data, 
--which are the top 10 and bottom 10 interests which have the largest composition values in any month_year? 
--Only use the maximum composition value for each interest but you must keep the corresponding month_year.

  WHERE month_year IS NOT NULL

--4. For the 5 interests found in the previous question - what were minimum and maximum percentile_ranking values for each interest 
--and its corresponding year_month value? Can you describe what is happening for these 5 interests?

--5. How would you describe our customers in this segment based off their composition and ranking values? 
--What sort of products or services should we show to these customers and what should we avoid?
