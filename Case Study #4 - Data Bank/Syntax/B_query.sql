--1. What is the unique count and total amount for each transaction type?

SELECT 
  txn_type,
  COUNT(*) AS unique_count,
  SUM(txn_amount) AS total_amount
FROM customer_transactions
GROUP BY txn_type;


--2. What is the average total historical deposit counts and amounts for all customers?

--3. For each month - how many Data Bank customers make more than 1 deposit and either 1 purchase or 1 withdrawal in a single month?

next_balance_customer AS (
  SELECT *,

  FROM customers_balance
),

--CTE 5: Calculate the increase percentage of closing balance for each customer
pct_increase AS (
